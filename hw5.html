<h2 style="text-align:right; color:crimson">The Ant And The Grasshopper</h2>
<h3 style="text-align:left">by Aesop</h3>
    <hr>
<p style="font-style:italic;"><strong><span><span style="font-size: 2em;">T</span>he Ant and the Grasshopper</span></strong>, also known as <strong><span>The Grasshopper and the Ant (or Ants)</span></strong> is one of the most famous of Aesop's Fables. This fable's moral lesson emphasizes the twin values of hard work and planning for the future.</p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-size: 2em;">O</span>ne bright day in late autumn a family of Ants were bustling about in the warm sunshine, drying out the grain they had stored up during the summer, when a starving Grasshopper, his fiddle under his arm, came up and humbly begged for a bite to eat.</p>
<p>"What!" cried the Ants in surprise, "haven't you stored anything away for the winter? What in the world were you doing all last summer?"</p> <!-- we can also use em tag instead -->
<p>"I didn't have time to store up any food," whined the Grasshopper; "I was so busy making music that before I knew it the summer was gone."</p>
<p>The Ants shrugged their shoulders in disgust.</p>
<p>"Making music, were you?" they cried. "Very well; now dance!" And they turned their backs on the Grasshopper and went on with their work.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">There's a time for work and a time for play.</p>
